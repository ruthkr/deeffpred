**deepredeff** is a package to predict effector protein given amino acid sequences. This tool can be used to predict effectors from three different taxa, which are oomycete, fungi, and bacteria.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `deepredeff` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("deepredeff")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ruthkr/deepredeff")
```

The `deepredeff` package uses TensorFlow. If you already have TensorFlow 2.0.0 or later in your system, then you can specify the environment where TensorFlow is installed using `reticulate::use_condaenv()`. Otherwise, you can install TensorFlow, by using the `install_tensorflow()` function as follows:

```r
library(deepredeff)
install_tensorflow()
```

**Note that this only needs to be run once**, the first time you use `deepredeff`.

## Documentation

To use `deepredeff`, you can read the documentation on the following topics:

1. [Getting started](https://ruthkr.github.io/deepredeff/articles/overview.html)
2. [Effector prediction with various different input formats and models](https://ruthkr.github.io/deepredeff/articles/predict.html)

## Quick start

This is a basic example which shows you how to predict effector sequences if you have a FASTA file:

```{r example}
# Load the package
library(deepredeff)

# Define the fasta path from the sample data
bacteria_fasta_path <- system.file(
  "extdata/example", "bacteria_sample.fasta", 
  package = "deepredeff"
)

# Predict the effector candidate using bacteria model
pred_result <- predict_effector(
  input = bacteria_fasta_path,
  taxon = "bacteria"
)
```

```r
# View results
pred_result
```

```{r pred-result, echo=FALSE}
pred_result %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    name = stringr::str_replace_all(name, "\\|", "âŽ®"),
    sequence = stringr::str_sub(sequence, 1, 25)
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

After getting the prediction results, you can plot the probability distribution of the results as follows:

```{r pred_result_plot, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5, out.width='670px', out.height='335px', fig.align='center'}
plot(pred_result)
```

More examples with different input formats are available on functions documentations and vignettes, please refer to the [documentation](https://ruthkr.github.io/deepredeff/).
