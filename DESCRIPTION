Description: A tool that contains trained deep learning models
    for predicting effector proteins. 'deepredeff' has been trained to
    identify effector proteins using a set of known experimentally
    validated effectors from either bacteria, fungi, or oomycetes.
    Documentation is available via several vignettes, and the paper by
